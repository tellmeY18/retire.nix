    # The macOS Tailscale app (system extension) owns /var/run/tailscale/
    # tailscaled.sock. Running a second tailscaled via launchd races for
    # that socket, loses, and can corrupt scutil DNS state on its way out.
    #
    # Instead: install only the CLI in environment.systemPackages
    # (hosts/darwin/configuration.nix) so `tailscale` works in the terminal
    # while the app handles the tunnel, tray icon, and DNS injection.
    #
    # tailscale = { enable = true; package = pkgs.tailscale; };
